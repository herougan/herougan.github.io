  Jay -> just a line, curves abit
  SAR (Super Auto Rocks) -> two lines
  Trade Hunter (Features d3.js) -> 3 lines

  ===== Main Page: Who am I =====

  Minimalist but also slightly brutalist vibe
  Customer Centric
  Design Thinking
  (Hovering over one, highlights one of them and puts it above the other)
  The words move into each other and out, like in a sin wave pattern, very slowly
  (Some letters turn red on hover - might be impossible unless we separate each text into their own col)
  On hover, image border (coloured, blows up and gsaps out. (increases in size - quite cool effect))

  Title-left and title-right words lay along the page
  they blend into the background when you scroll down
  Get Texture of Drink

  ----- Introduction ----

  Main .gif in the centre

  Text that floats behind, moving to the right
  Text that floats behind, moving to the left
  Colour burn effects, nice light smooth colours

  Huge Text that says "AGILE CUSTOMER CENTRIC DESIGN THINKING" or something even worse than that
  But it's focused such that, in 1s, the word customer begins scrolling across the screne. It's bright
  and complex.

  Then, in the 3rd section (so next, next), it comes down, and the word customer breaks down into
  its individual layers

  ----- Who -----

  Text on the left that floats in
  Text on the right that floats in

  Colour change to whole site at different sections
  A dog which runs around (and hides behind the role cards)
    they bounce up and towards to the right on hover. click makes it shake abit
  Picture is a carousel

  Sections:

    Intro
    
    Who

    Thingies
      - Subscribe button
      - Random infographics (LinkedIn + Web Post)

  ----- Me -----

  My portrait


  ===== Backlog Page: The Me-log/Me Backlog =====

  ---- What ----
  "Side Project Thingies" label
 
  Some of them 'flip' over like a vertical book
  Some of them rotate and fall off the 'hinges'

Showcases:

Highlighting some words in the who-card menu (animation)

Physics applied to some random item in the page

2.5d effect for background

*/


/*

Flatten view on mobile view
e.g. grid becomes size-1

Slowly add more fx bells and whistles as it goes - but finish the skeleton first
  e.g. square that moves right then reveals all the companies i worked for - also abit lame, but things like things
  e.g. black/white text against black white background, colour-inverse effect.
  e.g. Turning off the light deletes the words, but reveals pencil-drawn moons (recall effect from junji ito and spiderverse 2)

Game:

Qr Code then hides within folders

*/
/* Code smoothening

0) Only add hover over effects AFTER fade-in compelete
1) css (for title-shade) change images to same height and width; width changes at different media query points
Title text has a max-font-size but decreases automatically as the screen decreasess
2) typing should start midway - and only begin on start() callback (gsap)
3) Better project-cards (Title then text)
4) Buttons highlight slightly on hover
5) Fix mobile
  5b) For mobile, project cards appear from the left
6) photo collage for some of my better projects
