/* Ideas 

"Subscribe" - sends them an email

  ----- Banner -----
  Jay -> just a line, curves abit
  SAR (Super Auto Rocks) -> two lines
  Trade Hunter (Features d3.js) -> 3 lines

  ===== Main Page: Who am I =====

  Minimalist but also slightly brutalist vibe
  Customer Centric
  Design Thinking
  (Hovering over one, highlights one of them and puts it above the other)
  The words move into each other and out, like in a sin wave pattern, very slowly
  (Some letters turn red on hover - might be impossible unless we separate each text into their own col)

  **** Current Difficulty
  *   Width of pagee gets extended because anchor text goes through.
  *   Overflow: Hidden doesn't work
  *
  *   Idea: Change the width in animations too - create a horizontally-disappearing text
  ****

  Title-left and title-right words lay along the page
  they blend into the background when you scroll down

  ----- Introduction ----

  Main .gif in the centre

  Text that floats behind, moving to the right
  Text that floats behind, moving to the left
  Colour burn effects, nice light smooth colours

  ----- Who -----

  Text on the left that floats in
  Text on the right that floats in

  Colour change to whole site at different sections
  A dog which runs around

  Sections:

    Intro
    
    Who

    Thingies
      - Subscribe button
      - Random infographics (LinkedIn + Web Post)


  ===== Backlog Page: The Me-log/Me Backlog =====

  ---- What ----

  Some of them 'flip' over like a vertical book
  Some of them rotate and fall off the 'hinges'
